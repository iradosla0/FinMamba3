"""FI-2010 limit order book loader (Ntakaris et al. 2018).

FI-2010 is the canonical public benchmark for LOB mid-price forecasting,
used by DeepLOB and many follow-ups. Files are space-separated text in
shape (149, N_events):

  rows  0-39   : 10 levels x (ask_price, ask_size, bid_price, bid_size)
  rows  40-143 : derived hand-crafted features (ignored; we recompute ours)
  rows 144-148 : 5 horizon labels (k = 10, 20, 30, 50, 100 events)

The NoAuction ZScore variant is already per-stock per-day z-score normalized,
so the downstream replay buffer can consume it without a second normalization
pass. We still clip to the BasicSettings.NormClip window to match the
Polymarket pipeline's safety net.

Public entry point: load_fi2010_split(data_dir, split, horizon).
