"""Run a trained FinMamba3 world model as a competition backtester strategy.

Implements the BaseStrategy interface from lob.backtester.strategy (the same
contract the DATAHACKS competition harness uses). Each tick the active market's
order book is appended to a short rolling window of TickData and pushed through
the exact training feature pipeline (extract_features + normalization), so there
is no train/serve feature skew. The world-model direction head then picks a
bullish, bearish, or flat action, mirroring the offline GreedyDirectionPolicy.
