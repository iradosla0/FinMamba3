"""Predictability regime axis (newgoal-2 Phase 0.7).

The campaign's whole problem was finding a regime axis a FiLM router has a genuine reason to
encode. "How forecastable is this window" is exactly that latent: a selectively-betting policy
profits by trading the predictable windows and sitting out the random-walk ones. These three
cheap estimators on the underlying spot series quantify it; the Efficiency Ratio is the most
interpretable scalar and is the primary split axis, with permutation entropy and the Hurst
exponent as corroborating measures. Thresholds are fit on the train split, never hardcoded.
