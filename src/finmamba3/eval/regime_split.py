"""Regime-shift train/test split for evaluating non-stationarity adaptation.

The episodic-memory ablation thesis is "memory helps under regime shift,"
which only makes sense if there is an explicit shift. This module produces
two complementary splits over a sequence of resolved markets:

1. Time split: train on markets resolved before a cutoff date; evaluate on
   markets resolved after. Tests pure temporal generalization.
2. Volatility split: train on markets whose realized mid-volatility is below
   the training-set median; evaluate on the high-vol tail. Tests whether
   the model survives a vol regime change without seeing it in training.

Both splits return the same MarketLifecycle objects already used by the
backtester, so no data-format change is required downstream.

    into non-overlapping windows of window_len events, realized volatility is measured
