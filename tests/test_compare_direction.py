"""Unit tests for the helpers in eval/compare_direction.

Exercises the pure-Python helpers (label generation, accuracy/Brier scoring,
markdown formatting) that the CLI uses internally. The full main() flow needs
a trained checkpoint and a real LOBSequence; that path is exercised manually
during the diagnose/eval workflow rather than under unit tests.
